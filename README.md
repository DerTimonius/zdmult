# zdmult

Delete multiple zellij sessions at once, interactively

## Demo

I have written a similar tool for git branches, which works exactly the same, called [`gdmult`](https://github.com/DerTimonius/gdmult), where you can find a quick demo

## Installation

If you haven't installed Go already, [install Go](https://go.dev/dl/).

Then run the following:

```sh copy
go install github.com/DerTimonius/zdmult
```

## Usage

Run `zdmult` in your terminal and simply follow the instructions.
